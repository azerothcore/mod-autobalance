##########################


#
#   VASAutoBalance.reward.enable
#       This is an experimental feature to reward a player that kill a boss when
#       a pre-wotlk dungeon/raid is completed with creature levelling enabled.
#       This is an idea to boost old contents even if you're end-game player.
#
#       Default:     0 (1 = ON, 0 = OFF)

#   VASAutoBalance.reward.MinPlayerReward
#       This conf option checks how many players are in the same 
#       map before allowing the reward to be carried out
#       if MinPlayerReward is set to two and player is soloing this conf doesn't reward then.
#		this will give more a challenge to players for low level instances.

#       Default:     1
