#     AutoBalance.InflectionPoint series
#        Adjust value of Hyperbolic Tangent function where
#        the curve of scaling must change. A lower value means higher difficulty.
#        InflectionPoint is the fallback value for everything
#        InflectionPointRaid is the fallback value for raids
#        InflectionPointRaid25M is the fallback value for 25 man raids
#        InflectionPointRaid10M is the fallback value for 10 man raids
#        InflectionPointHeroic is the value for Heroic Dungeons
#        InflectionPointRaidHeroic is the value for heroic raids that are neither 10 man nor 25 man
#        InflectionPointRaid25MHeroic is the value for 25 man heroic raids
#        InflectionPointRaid10MHeroic is the value for 10 man heroic raids
#        The inflection points fallback to the most specific number
#
#        Example: with 0.5 in InflectionPointRaid, a creature of raid (40) will have half of its life with 20 players in
#                 with 0.8, the same creature will have half of its life with 12 players in

#     AutoBalance.LevelEndGameBoost
#        End game creatures have an exponential (not linear) regression

#        earn 1/5 of the total XP per kill, but if you solo the dungeon with
#        AutoBalance.DungeonScaleDownXP = 0, you will earn 5/5 of the total XP.

#

#       This is an experimental feature to reward a player that kill a boss when
#       a pre-wotlk dungeon/raid is completed with creature levelling enabled.
#       This is an idea to boost old contents even if you're end-game player.

#   AutoBalance.reward.MinPlayerReward
#       This conf option checks how many players are in the same
#       map before allowing the reward to be carried out
#       if MinPlayerReward is set to two and player is soloing this conf doesn't reward then.
#		this will give more a challenge to players for low level instances.
