# AUTOBALANCE ANNOUNCE
#
#     AutoBalanceAnnounce.enable
#        Announce the module on login

#
# AUTOBALANCE OPTIONS
#
#     AutoBalance.enable
#        Enable/Disable the autobalance system
#        Default:     1 (1 = ON, 0 = OFF)

AutoBalance.enable=1

#     AutoBalance.InflectionPoint series
#        Adjust value of Hyperbolic Tangent function where
#        the curve of scaling must change. A lower value means higher difficulty.
#        InflectionPoint & InflectionPointHeroic are the fallback values for 5-man dungeons
#        InflectionPointRaid10M & InflectionPointRaid10MHeroic are the fallback values for 10 man raids
#        InflectionPointRaid25M & InflectionPointRaid25MHeroic are the fallback values for 25 man raids
#        InflectionPointRaid & InflectionPointRaidHeroic are the fallback values for other raids (40-man, 20-man, 15-man, or custom size)
#        The inflection points fallback to the most specific number
#
#        Example: with 0.5 in InflectionPointRaid, a creature of raid (40) will have half of its life with 20 players in
#                 with 0.8, the same creature will have half of its life with 12 players in
#
#        Default:     0.5

#
#     AutoBalance.BossInflectionMult
#        Multiplies the inflection point of bosses, only applies to creatures considered dungeon bosses (from dungeons or raids).
#        Example: If AutoBalance.BossInflectionMult = 0.4 and AutoBalance.InflectionPoint=0.5, the bosses inflection point will be 0.4*0.9 = 0.36 in a normal dungeon.
#        Default:     1.0

#
#     AutoBalance.levelScaling
#        Check the max level of players in map and scale creature based on it.
#        This triggers depending on the two options below AutoBalance.levelHigherOffset and AutoBalance.levelLowerOffset
#        0 = Disabled
#        1 = Enabled (only in dungeons/raids)
#        Default:     1

#
#     AutoBalance.levelHigherOffset
#     AutoBalance.levelLowerOffset
#        Level Offsets between creatures will not be scaled by level.
#        You can even use it to disable scaling from lower to higher levelScaling
#        setting levelLowerOffset to 80 (max wotlk level) for example.
#        default: 3 (higher), 0 (lower)

#
#     AutoBalance.levelUseDbValuesWhenExists
#        When enabled with levelScaling, the creature will use its default database values
#        instead of level scaling formula when player/party level has correspondance with
#        creature_template minlevel/maxlevel.
#
#        Default:     0 (1 = ON, 0 = OFF)

#
#     AutoBalance.LevelEndGameBoost
#        End game creatures have an exponential (not linear) regression
#        that is not correctly handled by db values. Keep this enabled
#        to have stats as near possible to the official ones.

#
#     AutoBalance.DungeonScaleDownXP
#        Decrease individual player's amount of XP gained during a dungeon to match the
#        amount of XP gained during a full group run. Example: In a 5-man group, you
#        earn 1/5 of the total XP per kill, but if you solo the dungeon with
#        AutoBalance.DungeonScaleDownXP = 0, you will earn 5/5 of the total XP.
#        With the option enabled, you will earn 1/5.

#
#     AutoBalance.RaidsOnly

#     AutoBalance.rate.*
#        You can tune all rates increasing/decreasing difficulty in a linear way
#        Note that global rate will increase all other rates. For example:
#        global = 2.0 , damage = 1.5  -> it means that damage will be 3.0

#

#       This is an experimental feature to reward a player that kill a boss when

#   AutoBalance.reward.MinPlayerReward

#       if MinPlayerReward is set to two and player is soloing this conf doesn't reward then.
