## AutoBalance

- Latest build status with azerothcore: [![Build Status](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-autobalance/workflows/core-build/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-autobalance)

This module is intended to scale based on number of players, instance mobs and bosses' health, mana, and damage.

**NOTE:** This module requires at least [this commit](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/commit/f127e583aae3cfa51a77d056c1892a7de07ffb52) of AzerothCore in order to work correctly. Older versions are not supported.

All settings are well-described in the configuration file.

**PLEASE** include the output from the `.ab mapstat` and `.ab creaturestat` commands (while targeting a problematic creature) when reporting issues. This will help us to quickly identify the problem and provide a solution.

## In-game Commands
| Command | Permission | Description |
| :------ | :--------- | :---------- |
| `.ab mapstat` | All Players | Displays AB-calcualted settings for the current map, including player count, difficulty, world modifiers, and others. |
| `.ab creaturestat` | All Players | Displays AB-calculated settings for the targeted dungeon creature including level scaling, difficulty, modifiers, and boss status. |
| `.ab setoffset` | Game Masters | Sets the server-wide player difficulty offset. Instances will be scaled as though they had this many more/less players than they really do. |
| `.ab getoffset` | All Players | Gets the current server-wide player difficulty offset. Instances will be scaled as though they had this many more/less players than they really do. |
| `.reload config` | Game Masters | Reloads all your configuration files, including `AutoBalance.conf`. This lets you update AutoBalance settings without restarting your worldserver. This module is designed to contiue to work as expected when this command is issued. |
